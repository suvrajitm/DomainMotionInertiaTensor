# DomainMotionInertiaTensor
Quantitative Characterization of Domain Motions in Molecular Machines


Pending issue:  Due to the random eigenvector sign flipping, sometimes the axes sign switches direction from one pdb to another pdb. A robust fix for this is available in the literature, but did not have the time to implement that, since I moved on to a different project.

Simple criteria is there to check for the sign flip, but it is not enough, so if there is flipped axes coordinate from the output files and then a manual reversal of the sign of the coordinates is required and provide as input for calculating the motion between the sets of coordinates.
